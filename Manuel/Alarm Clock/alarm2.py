# Let's build a cool alarm clock! Here's how we'll do it step by step:

# Step 1: First, we need to import special tools (modules) that will help us
# - datetime: helps us work with dates and times
# - time: lets us pause our program
# - pytz: helps us work with different time zones
# - winsound: lets us make beeping sounds (like an alarm!)

# Step 2: Set up the time zone
# - We'll use the Indian time zone (but you can change it to your time zone!)
# - Get the current time in that time zone
# - Show the current time to make sure it's working

# Step 3: Ask the user when they want the alarm to go off
# - We'll ask them to type the time like this: 06:30:00 AM
# - We need to split this time into:
#   * Hours (like 06)
#   * Minutes (like 30)
#   * Seconds (like 00)
#   * AM or PM

# Step 4: Create an infinite loop that:
# - Checks the current time every second
# - Compares it with the alarm time
# - If they match, it's time to wake up!

# Step 5: When it's time to wake up:
# - Print "Wake Up!"
# - Make a beeping sound
# - Stop the program

# Here's what the program will do in simple words:
# 1. Ask you: "What time should I wake you up?"
# 2. Keep checking the time every second
# 3. When it matches your alarm time, make a loud beep!

# Now you can start coding! Replace each comment with real code.
# Remember to test your program after each step to make sure it works!

# Bonus Challenge:
# - Can you make it play different sounds?
# - Can you make it show a countdown until the alarm?
# - Can you add multiple alarms?
